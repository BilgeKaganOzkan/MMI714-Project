    "### Explanation of WatermarkDataset Class\n",
    "The `WatermarkDataset` class is a custom dataset implementation designed for handling datasets of watermarked images and their corresponding target (clear) images. It leverages a CSV file to retrieve the paths of images stored in a specified root directory, ensuring flexibility in dataset organization. The class resizes images to a given size, converts them to RGB format for consistency, and supports applying optional transformations, such as normalization or augmentation, to both input and target images. It includes a subsampling mechanism that allows users to skip over samples in the dataset, which is particularly useful for working with large datasets and enabling faster iterations during training."

    "### Explanation of DoubleConv, Down, Up, OutConv, and VAE Classes\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The `DoubleConv`, `Down`, `Up`, and `OutConv` classes serve as fundamental components in constructing the encoder-decoder architecture utilized in the `VAE` class. These modules facilitate various stages of feature extraction, downsampling, upsampling, and output generation, forming the backbone of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) designed specifically for watermark removal.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **DoubleConv** acts as a core building block that sequentially applies two convolutional layers, each followed by Batch Normalization and ReLU activation. This ensures effective feature extraction with normalization for stable training.\r\n",
    "- **Down** performs downsampling using a MaxPooling layer, followed by a `DoubleConv` module for extracting hierarchical features while reducing spatial dimensions.\r\n",
    "- **Up** focuses on upsampling the feature maps using a transposed convolution, followed by concatenation with skip connections from the encoder. It then applies a `DoubleConv` to refine the upsampled features, enabling high-resolution reconstruction.\r\n",
    "- **OutConv** is responsible for producing the final output of the model by reducing the number of channels and applying a Sigmoid activation. This is particularly suited for pixel-level predictions, such as mask generation or image reconstruction.\r\n",
    "- **VAE** integrates these components within an encoder-decoder framework and incorporates a latent space for compact representation. Additionally, it leverages a pre-trained YOLO model to identify watermark regions, using these predictions as an extra input channel to enhance the reconstruction process in masked areas.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The VAE model operates through three primary stages: detecting watermarked regions via YOLO, encoding the input image into a latent representation, and decoding this representation to reconstruct a watermark-free image. This modular design, combining feature extraction, downsampling, and upsampling with guidance from YOLO, enables precise and efficient watermar removal.\r\n"

    "### Explanation of VAELoss Class\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The `VAELoss` class is a specialized loss function designed for the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model to tackle watermark removal tasks. It integrates two key components: reconstruction loss and KL divergence loss, each playing a distinct role in enhancing the model's performance. The reconstruction loss focuses on minimizing pixel-wise differences between the reconstructed images and the target (ground truth) images. To ensure the model pays more attention to watermarked regions, the loss assigns higher weights to these areas using a weight map derived from the difference between the input and target images. This approach allows the model to prioritize the challenging regions affected by watermarks during training.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The second component, KL divergence loss, promotes regularization by encouraging the latent space to follow a standard normal distribution. This helps maintain a compact and stable latent representation, balancing reconstruction accuracy with effective regularization. The impact of KL divergence is controlled through a weighting factor (`kl_factor`), allowing flexibility in adjusting its influence during training. By combining these two components, `VAELoss` effectively guides the VAE model to achieve precise watermark removal while ensuring the latent space remains well-regularized and generalizable. This design makes it an essential component for training the VAE model to handle complex watermark removal challenes.\r\n",

    "The `testModel` function is designed to evaluate the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model on a test dataset, measuring its performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality. It computes the average test loss, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), which are critical metrics for assessing the quality of reconstructed images.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The function starts by preparing the test dataset, loading images from the specified path, and applying the necessary transformations such as resizing and normalization. The model is then set to evaluation mode using `model.eval()`, ensuring that layers like dropout and batch normalization behave correctly. To optimize memory usage and speed during evaluation, gradient computation is disabled using the `torch.no_grad()` context.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For each batch in the test dataset, the function calculates the test loss using the `VAELoss` function, which combines reconstruction and KL divergence terms. In addition to the loss, the function computes PSNR and SSIM metrics for each image, which evaluate the quality of reconstructed images compared to their ground truth. PSNR measures the signal fidelity, while SSIM assesses the perceptual similarity between images.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "After processing all batches, the function calculates the average test loss, PSNR, and SSIM values. These results are printed for immediate analysis and returned as a dictionary for further use, such as logging or comparison with other models. The `testModel` function provides a comprehensive evaluation framework, ensuring that the model's performance is measured accurately on unsen data.\r\n",

    "### Explanation of `initModelWeights` Function\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The `initModelWeights` function is responsible for initializing the weights and biases of the layers in the VAE model, ensuring effective training by starting with well-initialized parameters. Proper weight initialization helps prevent issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients, which can hinder the learning process.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The function applies specific initialization techniques tailored to different layer types in the model. For convolutional layers (`nn.Conv2d` and `nn.ConvTranspose2d`), it uses Kaiming Normal (He Initialization) to initialize the weights. This method is particularly suited for layers with ReLU activations, as it maintains a consistent variance of activations across layers. The biases for these layers are set to 0 to ensure no initial offset in the computations.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For batch normalization layers (`nn.BatchNorm2d`), the scale parameter (weight) is initialized to 1, ensuring that the initial normalization preserves the scale of inputs. The shift parameter (bias) is set to 0, providing a neutral starting point for normalization adjustments.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the case of linear layers (`nn.Linear`), the function employs Xavier Normal initialization for weights. This technique is effective for layers with linear or sigmoid activations, as it maintains a balanced variance of activations across layers. Biases for linear layers are also initialized to 0, ensuring consistency across different layer types.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "By handling multiple layer types and applying the most suitable initialization techniques, the `initModelWeights` function provides flexible and robust weight initialization.

    "### No Logo And Low Opacity Model: Hyperparameter Optimization, Training, and Testing\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This code block outlines the comprehensive workflow for training the **No Logo Low Opacity VAE Model**, encompassing hyperparameter optimization, training, and testing.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The process begins by defining the paths for the training and test datasets. These paths are constructed by appending the respective dataset folder names to the current working directory. To ensure the integrity of the workflow, the script checks for the existence of these directories. If any of the specified paths are missing, an error is raised, preventing further execution.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning is then initiated using the `startHyperparameterTuning` function. This function leverages the Hyperband scheduler with Ray Tune to explore various combinations of hyperparameters, including learning rate, batch size, KL divergence weight, latent dimension, and number of epochs. The key inputs to this function are:\r\n",
    "- A transformation pipeline (`transform`) for preprocessing images.\r\n",
    "- A weight initialization function (`initModelWeights`) to ensure proper model setup.\r\n",
    "- The training dataset path (`train_path`) for data preparation.\r\n",
    "- The image size (`image_size`) for resizing inputs.\r\n",
    "- The computation device (`device`), which is either GPU or CPU, depending on availability.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The hyperparameter optimization process identifies the best configuration, which is then logged and used for model training. Once the optimal parameters are determined, the `startTraining` function is called to train the model using K-Fold Cross Validation. This robust training approach ensures that the model is validated across multiple dataset splits, enhancing its generalization and reducing the risk of overfitting.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "During training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as reconstruction loss, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These metrics provide insights into the quality of the reconstructed images and the overall effectiveness of the model.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "After training, the model is tested on a separate test dataset to assess its performance on unseen data. The trained model and its associated results are saved with a descriptive name that includes details such as the image size and number of folds used in cross-validation. This ensures that the model can be easily identified and reused for future tasks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Finally, the script confirms the successful completion of the hyperparameter optimization, training, and testing workflow, providing a comprehensive solution for watermark removal tasks wth the VAE model.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "### ***IMPORTANT NOTE***\r\n",
